Multi Tier Web Application Stack
Setup on Laptop/Deskop
Baseline for Upcoming Projects
Helps you setup any project locally

Scenario
working in a project
varieties of services that powers your project runtime.
(RunBook / Setup document)

Problem
Not comfortable in making changes in real servers.
local setup is complex
time consuming
not repeatable

Solution
Local setup will be Automated, Repeatable, Code [IAAC]
R&D in your own machine.

Tools
Hypervisor - Oracle VM Virtualbox
Automation _ Vagrant
CLI - Git Bash
IDE - Sublime text

Objective
VM Automation locally
Real world project setup locally [for R&D]

Vprofile Project
Architecture of project services
NGINX
TOMCAT
RABBITMQ
MEMCACHED
MYSQL

Architecture of Automated Setup
VAGRANT
VIRTUALBOX
GITBASH

Architectural design
After setting up our stack, user can access our services from browser
entering ip address or an endpoint,
The user will be redirected to Load balancer.
we will setup NGINX service which will act like a load balancer
NGINX service is then going to forward the request to application server
Apache Tomcat will be our application server where our java application
will be running we can even have a shared storage by using NFS
Application server will then forward the request to RABBITMQ which will be
our message broker and that will send the request to MEMCACHED for database
caching.
MEMCACHED is going to cache the SQL queries which was executed for the MYSQL
server.

Design for Automation stack
we will be using VAGRANT to automatically setup our virtual machine
Vagrant is going to communicate with Oracle VirtualBox which is the
hypervisor and create automatically virtual machines on that then we
will be using bash scripts or command to setup services.

Flow of execution
Setup tools mentioned in prerequisite video
clone source code
cd into vagrant dir
bring up VM's
validate
Setup All the services
a. Mysql
b. Memcached
c. Rabbit MQ
d. Tomcat
e. Nginx
f. App Build & Deploy
Verify from browser
